I forked yuriykulikov's FreeRTOS port and added the FreeRTOS 7.0.2 kernel. It was tested on ATXmega128a4u and ATXmega128a3u. The sources are in form of AtmelStudio project (AtmelStudio 6.2). It utilizes a few ASF drivers: "Delay routines", "Generic board support", "IOPORT". Some drivers are supported manually in "MyDrivers" directory.

The demo runs 4 tasks
- two LED blinkink tasks with differend period
- USART loopback task
- TWI (I2C) Master&Slave loopback task
